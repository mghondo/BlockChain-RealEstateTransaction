# FracEstate: Cross-Chain Fractional Real Estate Tokenization

**FracEstate** is a modern decentralized application (**DApp**) built with **React 18** and **Web3** technology that revolutionizes real estate investment by enabling **fractional ownership** through the **ERC-1155** standard. Each property is tokenized into exactly **100 shares**, making it accessible for retail investors. The platform features a production-ready **React frontend**, complete **Web3 integration**, supports multiple buyers, uses **USDC** stablecoin for payments, generates yield via **Aave v3**, and features cross-chain deposit capabilities through **LayerZero** protocol.

---

## üìã Overview

**FracEstate** transforms real estate transactions by tokenizing properties into **ERC-1155 NFTs**, split into 100 shares for shared ownership. The platform features a **modern React 18 frontend** with complete **Web3 integration**, providing users with an intuitive interface for fractional real estate investment. An advanced escrow contract ensures secure, transparent, and profitable transactions using **USDC** payments and **Aave yield**. The platform includes **cross-chain functionality**, enabling users to deposit USDC from **Polygon** to **Ethereum** while maintaining all core features including yield generation and fractional ownership.

---

## üåâ Cross-Chain Architecture

### Core Components

**LayerZero Integration**
- Secure, decentralized cross-chain messaging protocol
- Polygon to Ethereum USDC bridging with automatic processing
- Emergency refund mechanism for failed transactions
- Nonce-based replay protection

**Enhanced Security Features**
- **24-Hour Timelock**: All withdrawals (finalize/cancel) require 24-hour delay
- **KYC Verification**: Mandatory KYC for all participants via oracle
- **Gas Optimizations**: Reduced gas costs through contract optimizations
- **Cross-Chain Security**: LayerZero trusted remote configuration

### Contract Architecture

1. **EscrowWithStableAndYieldCrossChain.sol** (Ethereum)
   - Main escrow contract with LayerZero receiver capabilities
   - 24-hour timelock for withdrawals
   - KYC verification integration
   - Multi-buyer fractional ownership support

2. **PolygonUSDCBridge.sol** (Polygon)
   - USDC collection and LayerZero message sending
   - Refund mechanism for failed transfers
   - Gas estimation for cross-chain operations

3. **KYCOracle.sol**
   - KYC verification management with batch support
   - Expiration-based verification system
   - Integration with escrow contracts

4. **RealEstate.sol**
   - ERC-1155 fractional ownership NFTs
   - Fixed 100 shares per property
   - IPFS metadata storage

---

## üè† Fractional Ownership

**FracEstate** uses the **ERC-1155** standard to tokenize properties into **100 fixed shares**, enabling retail investors to purchase affordable fractions (e.g., $1,000/share for a $100,000 property). This upgrade from **ERC-721** supports multiple owners, reducing entry barriers and enhancing liquidity.

### Implementation Details
- **Minting**: `RealEstate.sol` mints 100 shares per property to the seller, storing metadata URIs (e.g., IPFS for property details)
- **Share Allocation**: Escrow contract initializes buyers with shares summing to 100 (e.g., [30, 70] or [25, 25, 25, 25])
- **Transfers**: On finalization, shares are distributed via `safeTransferFrom` to buyers based on their allocation
- **Cross-Chain Compatible**: Shares can be allocated through cross-chain deposits

### Benefits
- Affordable fractions for retail investors
- Tradeable shares compatible with wallets and exchanges
- Cross-chain accessibility for global investors
- Comprehensive testing in `RealEstate.js` and `CrossChainRealEstate.js`

## üîí Enhanced Escrow Functionality

The escrow system manages secure, phased transactions with **USDC** and **Aave yield**, upgraded for multi-buyer fractional ownership and cross-chain capabilities.

| **Phase**             | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Created (0)           | Escrow initialized with buyers, shares, and property details                   |
| EarnestDeposited (1)  | Buyers deposit proportional USDC earnest (via Ethereum or cross-chain)        |
| Approved (2)          | Inspector sets pass/fail; all buyers, seller, and lender approve              |
| FullyFunded (3)       | Lender deposits remaining USDC (e.g., $80,000 for $100,000 price)            |
| Completed (4)         | Principal + yield withdrawn from Aave, funds to seller, shares to buyers      |
| Cancelled (5)         | Refunds principal + proportional yield to buyers/lender (if inspection fails) |

### Security Features

**Timelock Protection**
```solidity
struct TimelockAction {
    uint256 executeAfter;
    bool isPending;
    bytes32 actionType;
}
```
- 24-hour mandatory delay for all withdrawals
- Protection against bridge-related attacks
- Separate timelocks for finalization and cancellation

**KYC Integration**
```solidity
modifier onlyKYCVerified(address user) {
    if (!config.kycOracle.isKYCVerified(user)) {
        revert KYCNotVerified(user);
    }
    _;
}
```
- All participants must be KYC verified
- Expiration-based verification system
- Batch verification for efficiency

---

## üåç User Flow

### 1. Setup Phase
```solidity
// Deploy contracts on both chains
// Verify KYC for all participants
await kycOracle.verifyKYC(buyerAddress, validityPeriod);

// Initialize buyers and shares
await escrow.initializeBuyers([buyer1, buyer2], [50, 50]);
```

### 2. Cross-Chain Deposit (Polygon ‚Üí Ethereum)
```solidity
// Approve USDC on Polygon
await polygonUSDC.approve(bridge.address, amount);

// Estimate LayerZero fees
const [fee, ] = await bridge.estimateFee(amount, shares, false, "0x");

// Initiate cross-chain deposit
await bridge.initiateDeposit(amount, shares, "0x", { value: fee });
```

### 3. Automatic Processing on Ethereum
- LayerZero delivers message to escrow contract
- KYC verification checked automatically
- USDC supplied to Aave for yield generation
- Phase progression tracked

### 4. Transaction Finalization with Timelock
```solidity
// Initiate 24-hour timelock
await escrow.initiateFinalizeSale();

// Wait 24 hours, then execute
await escrow.finalizeSale(); // After timelock expires
```
